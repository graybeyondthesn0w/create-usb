## How do I find out my system codename?
Press ESC, Refresh, and the Power Button, together.
Usually, on the bottom of where it says to put in a recovery stick, there should be a jumble of letters and/or numbers in gray text, at the end of it, it should say your system codename.
If you have a recovery menu that is a dark theme, you may need to look around the recovery menu to find it.
If your system isn't here, it is most likely incompatible.

# Use the prebuilt disk image (recommended)

Note: You will need atleast a 16GB sized USB Drive/SD Card!

> These instructions are for the mt8183 (and mt8173 coming soon) line of Chromebooks ONLY! You will also need sudo permissions, developer mode, and USB boot enabled.

## 1. Downloading, extracting, and flashing the disk image

First, we will need to download the image file. Download the image you want in the "Disk Image Releases" section below (NOTE: Try to select the latest image).

### Disk Image Releases (Hosted on MEGA.nz)

[Ubuntu 22.04](https://mega.nz/file/2McigCCK#qqGJ4vrkecRVWKscxhQ1kxS5uKA9Vl64hsRJG534QVs)

[Ubuntu 23.10 - Wi-Fi BROKEN - DO NOT USE](https://mega.nz/file/LEtk3RLb#BCBwhxv7yO6SKarAlZj54r4979ANJRtV3qY6-bAuejM)


Now, open up a terminal and type and ```cd``` into the directory where the downloaded image is (usually ~/Downloads).

> WARNING: THIS STEP WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON THE TARGET DRIVE!

Then, type in ```cat ubuntu-unity.img.gz | gunzip | sudo dd of=/dev/TARGET```

> Make sure to replace TARGET with the device node of your target USB/SD Card (eg. sda, sdb, mmcblk0).

## 2. Booting into the USB/SD Card

> Remember! This guide always assumes you have developer mode with usb booting enabled.

Insert the USB/SD Card into one of the available USB ports (do not use a USB/SD Card dongle, it will not work!)
                                                                                                   
Then, turn on the computer and press CTRL+U to boot into the USB.

> NOTE: The username is linux and the password is ubuntuunity

Login with the username and password above.

Once you reach the Unity Desktop, open up the terminal.

Then, type in ```sudo bash /scripts/extend-rootfs.sh```

This will increase the size of the root partition from the default size of ~16GB and make it the highest it can go, to get the most disk space.

## 3. Installing to internal storage (optional)

Follow all of step 1, but replace TARGET with the device node of the internal storage (usually mmcblk0).
> If anything goes wrong, or it's unbootable, reinstall chromeOS, or boot your Ubuntu Unity USB drive to fix it.
> Don't hesitate on installing it to the eMMC storage, it wont fail as long you do it right. 

# Make your own Ubuntu Unity Image
Run auto.sh from this repository (on Ubuntu/Debian!) and flash the image generated to a USB Drive or SD Card. You can also tweak the script, like changing the Ubuntu version, kernel, etc.
