# Use the prebuilt disk image (recommended)

Note: You will need atleast a 8GB sized USB Drive/SD Card!

> These instructions are for the mt8183 and mt8173 line of Chromebooks ONLY! You will also need root, developer mode, and USB boot enabled.

## 1. Downloading and flashing the disk image 

First, we will need to download the image file. Download the image you want in the "Disk Image Releases" section below (NOTE: Try to select the latest image).

### Disk Image Releases (Hosted on MEGA.nz)

[Ubuntu 22.04 - MT8183 ONLY (DEPRECATED - USE 24.04)](https://mega.nz/file/2McigCCK#qqGJ4vrkecRVWKscxhQ1kxS5uKA9Vl64hsRJG534QVs)

[Ubuntu 23.10 - Wi-Fi BROKEN - MT8183 ONLY - DO NOT USE](https://mega.nz/file/LEtk3RLb#BCBwhxv7yO6SKarAlZj54r4979ANJRtV3qY6-bAuejM)

[Ubuntu 24.04 - MT8173, MT8183 CROSS PLATFORM - MAIN RELEASE](https://mega.nz/file/QMQCnKDS#JEQLL6gnerbfsRu_7zUJjf2zpLKSNSIOIMVOdu6q-vc)

Now, open up a terminal and ```cd``` into the directory where the downloaded image is (usually ~/Downloads).

> WARNING: THIS STEP WILL ERASE ALL DATA ON THE TARGET DRIVE!

Then, type in ```sudo dd if=[your image location] of=/dev/TARGET bs=1M status=progress```
For Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10 images (UNSUPPORTED!), run ```cat ubuntu-unity.img.gz | gunzip | sudo dd of=/dev/TARGET```

> Make sure to replace TARGET with the device node of your target USB/SD Card (eg. sda, sdb, mmcblk0), and replace your image location with where your image is located. 

## 2. Booting into the USB/SD Card

# This does include your eMMC, any instructions in this section will be the same.

> Remember! This guide always assumes you have developer mode with usb booting enabled.

Insert the USB/SD Card you flashed into one of the available USB ports (do not use a USB/SD Card dongle, it will not work!)
                                                                                                   
Then, turn on the computer and press CTRL+U to boot into the USB.

> NOTE: The username is unity and the password is ubuntu
> For Ubuntu 22.04 and 23.10 images, username is linux and password is ubuntuunity

Login with the username and password above.

Once you reach the Unity Desktop, open up the terminal.

Then, type in ```sudo bash /scripts/extend-rootfs.sh```

This will increase the size of the root partition from the default size of ~8GB and make it the highest it can go, to utilize the most disk space.

## 3. Installing to internal storage (optional)

Follow all of step 1, but replace TARGET with the device node of the internal storage (usually mmcblk0).
> If anything goes wrong, or it's unbootable, reinstall chromeOS, or boot your Ubuntu Unity USB drive to fix it.
> Don't hesitate on installing it to the eMMC storage, it wont fail as long you do it right. 

# Make your own Ubuntu Unity Image
Run auto.sh from this repository (on Ubuntu/Debian!) and flash the image generated to a USB Drive or SD Card. You can also tweak the script, like changing the Ubuntu version, kernel, etc.
